# Vaccines-Lab-to-Needle
R&amp;D Project incorporating the fields if IoT and Blockchain to ensure a clarity in the supply chain of vaccines to patients. The Project involves collection of the physical paramters of the vaccine such as Temperature, Humidity etc with the help of the DHT22 sensor interfaced with the ESP8266 and then uploaded onto the cloud. Cloud Platform used in this project is the Thingspeak cloud Platform. Any for of discreprencies in the data is stored and noted onto the blockchain to ensure transparency and also to prevent any form of misuse of the vaccines.
